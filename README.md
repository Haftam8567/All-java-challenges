# Java Challenges

This repository contains a collection of Java programming challenges, organized by chapter. Each folder represents a specific challenge with its own source code and description.

## How to Navigate

- Each `ChapterX_Challenge_Y` folder contains a separate, self-contained Java project or source file.
- Inside each challenge folder, you'll find a `README.md` that explains the specific requirements of that challenge.

Happy coding!
